# Decentralized-Political-Voting-System
With the help of Siraj Raval's Dapp tutorial, I was able to learn how to build a decentralized application using Ethereum and Web3.js

This code is that was provided in a youtube video. I mainly used this as a way to get familiar with the Dapp process of using the npm to install web3.js and ethereum's test blockchain and then deploying the political voting system.
