# Decentralized-Political-Voting-System
I was able to learn how to build a decentralized application using Ethereum and Web3.js with the help of online tutorials

The basic code that was used was provided in this tutorial. I mainly used this as a way to get familiar with the DApp process of using the npm to install web3.js and Ethereum's test blockchain to deploy a decentralized political voting system where a user's choice of political candidate is stored permanently on the blockchain, an immutable database, thereby preventing voting manipulation.
